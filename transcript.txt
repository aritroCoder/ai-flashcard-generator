100, 10, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100. Theta is equal to, one said, minus, minus 120 degree. Okay, lets make it. Zero. Zero is here. Minus means clock wise. It will go from below. Minus 90. Minus 180. Here, between these 2. Between these 2, something like this will come. Minus 120 degree. He came to make it. He said, make one mole, monkey. 6.02 into 10 to the power of 23. I am having fun. We will make it clock wise. Okay, will the fear of minus end? It is not that tough, minus angle. Instead of this, he made it like this. He said, go minus 10 steps ahead. This is what is called minus. He changed the direction. Nothing else. Is it clear? Is it clear? Is it simple? Tell me. Now the question is to plot the angle. You don't know which quadrant will have angle. For your hint. This is first quadrant, this is second. This is third. This is fourth. Which quadrant will have 135 degree? Tell me, you have to tell. I have given the hint in front of you. Should I do it first? It is easy, it is not difficult. It is going to be a lot of fun. Tell me quickly. You just have to find out which quadrant is coming. After that, you will understand the next level. Tell me. Which quadrant will have 135 degree angle? 0 90 180 Here it will come somewhere. Theta is equal to 135 degree. Which quadrant did it come in? It came in the second quadrant. It will become something like this. This will come in the second quadrant. I will have to change the color every second. Did everyone understand the question? Tell me which quadrant will have 150 degree angle? 150 is also less than 180. It is greater than 90. It will come somewhere here. It will come in the second quadrant. 225 0 90 180 270 It is greater than 180. Which quadrant did it come in? It came in the third quadrant. Tell me which quadrant will have 330 degree angle? Now you tell me. It is a simple question. In our syllabus, things outside 360 do not go. Tell me quickly. It is in the fourth quadrant. 0 90 180 270 360 It must have come somewhere here. Which quadrant will it come in? It will come in the fourth quadrant. Will you tell the quadrant by looking at the angle? Can you tell the quadrant by looking at the angle?
It is very simple. The second movie is going on. After this, you will get all this in trigonometry. It will be fun. In yesterday's lecture, you had a problem in finding the quadrant. I had seen a lot. When there is a lot of doubt, the professor changes the whole method. See now. Which quadrant will 90 minus theta come in? Now keep the pen. I will give you time to write later. All of you see carefully. Put the pen down. We will read first. Otherwise, you will not understand later. See carefully. 90 minus theta When we write theta, it is an acute angle. It will be 5, 10, 15, 20. It will be smaller than 90. Theta is acute. Theta is acute. 90 minus theta The value will be smaller than 90. See. This is 0. This is 90. Where will 90 minus theta come? It will be smaller than 90. It will come here. Which quadrant will it be? This 90 is not complete. It is a little less than 90. 90 minus theta Which quadrant will come? First quadrant. Tell me. Which quadrant will 90 plus theta come in? A little more than 90. Tell me. It is a little more than 90. It will come in the second quadrant. Do you understand? Where will 180 minus theta come? This is the game that you have to learn in today's class. Where will 180 minus theta come? Tell me quickly. Where will 180 minus theta come? It is a little less than 180. It is a little less than 180. It came here. Which quadrant will come? Second quadrant. 180 plus theta It is a little more than 180. It went here. Third quadrant. Very good. Understand. It is very simple. It is not 2 or 1. It is fixed. You can tell me 1, 2, 3, 4. Where will it come? 270 is complete. It could not be complete. It stopped before. 270 minus theta I had to erase it. It is simple. You can see it like this. Make 270. Theta minus means a little minus. Where did it come? Third quadrant. 270 plus theta Make 270. Plus theta I had to add a little. Where did it go? Fourth quadrant. 360 minus theta Make 360. Minus theta I had to do a little minus. How much will it come? Fourth quadrant. 360 plus theta Make 360. I had to add more. Where did it come again? In the first quadrant. This is the quadrant. Identify the angle. Which quadrant? Now understand everything. After this, it will be easier. I am holding it by rotating it in every way. Now we will flip the whole game of trigonometry. All this is clear. It is a very simple thing. We are taking the last and final pole on it. If it is clear, then we have two concepts. You will come to the third concept. Get ready soon. Do you understand? If all this is clear, then we will come to the third concept. And now slowly everything will start combining. Everything will be combined. Are you ready? Are you ready? Will it work? We will see the doubt. There will be a doubt session. Are you ready for the third movie? It's going to be a lot of fun. Now in this movie, things will start coming together. Two different concepts with the third concept together which will make the words of trigonometry. It will be fun. Are you ready? See the repeat. This is 90-3, so make 90. It is a little less than that. Look, I made 90. It is a little less than that. It came like this. Less than 90. How much is the first quadrant? 90.
More than 90. It became the second quadrant. It is a little less than 180. It is a little less than 270. It is in the third quadrant. Is it clear? Let's go. Now comes the movie number 3. Are you all excited for movie number 3? Its name is Sine. What is the name of the movie? Sine Theta. Third movie. Sine Theta. And we will talk only about Sine Theta. Cos, Tan, Van. Nothing. We will talk only about Sine Theta. So let's talk about Sine. Let's talk about Sine Theta. First thing. Sine Theta. Let's talk about Sine Theta. First thing. Let's understand. Relation of Sine Theta. We will find out everything. There will be a lot of things on Sine Theta. Are you ready? First of all, Sine Theta is reversed. Inverse. What is this? Cos Theta. Cos Theta. What is the inverse of Sine Theta? Cos Theta. Sine Theta. Which all quadrants are positive? First. Second. Third. Fourth. Yesterday, we studied mnemonic. All Sindhoor. All Sindhoor target conquered. All. Sindhoor target conquered. All. AST. All. All are positive. Sindhoor. Sindhoor sign. Sindhoor sign. Ten and Cos. They are negative and negative. Sign. Take. Wife. Cos. We will find out what this is. What is the opposite of sign? Cos. Sign's wife is Cos. We will use this now. Okay. Let's go. This is the birth chart of sign. Basic of sign. Sign is coming. Sign is coming in Sindoor. All are positive. In second only sign is positive. In third and fourth, sign is negative. Is it clear? Simple. This is the birth chart of sign. Sign's values. Let's go. Sign is zero. Sign is 30. If you don't remember the values, I am reminding you. Half. Half root 2. Half root 3. 90. Remember it directly. Sign is zero. Sign is 30. Half root 2. Half is 1 by 2. Half root 2 is half into root 2. You can write it as 1 by root 2. Half root 3 is root 3 by 2. Remember it. Entry. Special guest entry. Concept 1 has come. I have seen you in questions this time also. They will not give. NTA doesn't like this degree. NTA will give question like this. Sign is zero. Sign of 5 by 6. Sign of 5 by 4. Sign of 5 by 3. Sign of 5 by 2. After seeing this, you get confused. There is a problem. Now I have understood why Radian is there.
You will find these values very less in school exams also. NTA also gives these values very less. NTA says 30. It can work by saying 30. I said I won't say. I will say Radian. Actually, the child gets confused. He doesn't have the habit of seeing Radian. Okay. You know this. What has happened? So now you should get one second in your mind. That yes, zero will be zero. What is 5 by 6? It is said to be 30 degrees. 3 by 6. So this sign is given only 30. Did you understand, boy? This will be 1 by 2 only. Okay. Did you understand? Okay. If we don't read this Radian. The one hour that we read. Think how the professor has read it to you. This is the new guest entry of concept 1. It enters like this. Now you will see. The second concept will also enter in this. Now this 5 by 4 should be known. It is 45 degrees. So you can keep it half root 2 or 1 by root 2. 5 by 3 is sin 60. So do you understand how these people use Radian, son? So from now on, in the exam, until the school exam. They don't give 30, 60, 40. From now on, everything. Once again say bye bye degree. Welcome Radian. Now everywhere you will get Radian, Radian, Radian, son. So don't worry about Radian. If you say 5 by 2, it is 90 degrees. 1 Did you understand, son? Did you understand, children? Is it clear to everyone? What is the use of Radian? From now on, the wild card entry will work for them, son. Radian will only work. Now it takes a little time to see this, son. So I am asking you to take out all the Radian twice or three times in the class. Which convert degree to Radian to degree. Do it 4-5 times. Then it will be set in the mind, okay? So now this problem will start in the school. And also to our NTA people. I don't know, the degree was going well. No, no, no, we have to do something different. Now they give Radian. And such a unit is also Radian, son. Okay, let's go. When it was a matter of sign in the right angle triangle. So this is perpendicular and this is hypotenuse. The value of sine theta was. Perpendicular upon hypotenuse. It's a simple thing, everyone knows. There is no need to do any drama in it. It's a simple thing, okay? It's very simple, nothing difficult. Okay. Now. Sine in four quadrants. Now, son, here is a little tough part. Everyone put the pen down. Everyone look behind. Put the pen down, son. Everyone put the pen down. Everyone put the pen down. Everyone put the pen down. Please join your hands and ask everyone. This is a tough thing. This does not understand. You have to look very carefully. Now all our things are going to be used together. How do you get the value of sine in four quadrants? What is our target? These values. Sine. 90 minus theta. You have read it in the small class. But it will not end here. Sine. 90 plus theta. Sine. 180 minus theta. Sine. 180 plus theta. Sine. 270 minus theta. Sine. 270 plus theta. Sine. 360 minus theta. Sine. 360 plus theta. Sine. Minus theta. Sine. Minus theta. Sine. Minus theta. Sine. Minus theta. Sine. Minus theta. Sine. Minus theta. Sine. Minus theta. Sine. Minus theta. Sine. Minus theta. Sine. Minus theta. Sine. Minus theta. Sine. This is what the students learn. And these people leave the whole table. I will teach you a technique. You don't have to keep anything. First of all, rule 1. All the vermilion targets are conquered. You have to tell me which quadrant is this? Entry. Quadrant. Tell me. Tell me in which quadrant is sine 90 minus theta? The guest entry has been done, Let me see again. OK. Tell me quickly. First quadrant. Tell me quickly. First quadrant. So now, I will tell you. Start. Sine. 90 minus theta. Sine. 90. 90 plus theta. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9.
9. 10. 360 plus. Minus sine. Sine negative. First, note this much. Everyone, note this much. Now, see this. Whatever we use, how much is used. And this only changes. Sine, Cos, etc. Okay? It's very simple. Okay? You have understood this. This is the most important thing. You have to identify which coordinate it is. So, I am telling you. Now, practice this part a little. What I was doing. Movie number 2. Which coordinate is this? 90 minus theta first. 90 plus theta second. 180 minus theta second. 180 plus theta third. 270 minus theta third. Then fourth, fourth. Practice a little like this. Okay? If you do this 2-4 times, you will get perfection. For now, I will write for a hint. Okay? I will give you a little hint. So that you don't have a problem. While solving. Letters, background, fill. I am giving a hint. I am giving a hint personally. Okay? So that you don't have a problem. Hint. See. 90 plus theta first. 90 minus theta second. 90 plus theta third. 180 plus theta second. 390 plus theta third. 390 plus theta from the worst mathematics. Okay? 360 plus theta minus theta. 360 plus theta. positive 180 plus theta third negative 270 minus theta in the third negative 270 plus theta in the 4th negative 360 minus theta in the 4th negative 360 plus theta then goes to first positive theta minus theta in 4th negative You can understand
this well. But it will become cos theta, which you have already studied, sin 90 plus theta, who is the wife of 90, what happens at 90, the wife is captured, what happens to sin, cos theta, no one is captured at 180, sin theta will remain sin theta, no one is captured at 180, sin theta will remain sin theta, capture at 270, the wife of sin will capture cos, capture at 270, the wife of sin will capture cos, no one is captured at 360, sin will remain sin, sin will remain sin, no one is captured, sin will remain sin, this is how you get the values you have only studied this much in the 10th class, and I have taught you everything, people leave the whole table, people leave the whole table, you don't have to leave it, you have quickly solved this thing with the concept, you don't even know, people leave this, and this is not that I am talking about sin, people leave the tables of sin, cos, tan, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9 into 3, people leave 27 identities, which you don't have to leave if you have done 2 rules, okay, you understand the logic behind it, but it will take some time to understand it, it will take some level to understand it, but first learn to remove this, let's do it again, okay, let's do it once again, always remember rule 1, rule 2, movie number 1 can also come in this, write pi by 2 instead of 90, so don't worry, there is a question in dbb, I have given a different type, there is only one question of that type, you will be a little scared to see it, but don't be scared, I told you first, don't be scared, okay, let's remove it for cos and tan, it will be fun, we will do it again, then we will understand the logic at the end, everyone will not understand the logic, okay, now look, it will take a little brain to understand it, first look carefully, what is the first step, don't do this, don't exchange rule 1, 2, first rule 1, then rule 2, right, okay, hey, let's see quickly, what will happen first, rule 1, then ruler 2 will come, okay, and because of this, we will get any value, I am not kidding, any value will come, I will tell you, it will be fun, let's see, first of all, we will see in which quadrant, int is in front of you, and by looking at this, what can you do, you can put a sign, so you will put a sign, look again, 90 minus theta, look here, find out what is coming, it is coming in first, we will put plus, 90 plus theta, what comes in the second, plus comes in the sign, 180 minus theta, in the second, plus will come in the sign, 180 plus theta, in the third, minus comes, 270 minus theta, in the third, plus theta, in the fourth, minus theta, 60, minus.
360 plus theta, where did it go, in the first, find minus theta, where does minus theta come, in the fourth, next simple rule, if you put plus minus first, son, otherwise you will make a mistake, okay, rule number 1, first we will put plus minus, after that rule number 2 will come, rule number 2 is 90 plus 270, so it will be taken, it will not be taken, it will not be taken, underline it, it will be taken, it will be taken, where it will be taken, it will be cos, cos theta, cos theta, cos theta, okay, clear, where it will not be taken, it will be sin, sin theta, sin theta, sin theta, sin theta, come son, it is simple, this is a very simple concept, it is clear, it is not boring, if you find it boring, I am sorry, but it is not boring, son, now everyone understood, yes or no, if you remember this or make this concept, what we learned before in movie number 2, then it will be very easy, son, did you understand, see we did not study up to this level, but now you will have to level up, you will have to use your brain a little, you will not get neat by eating asanas, son, okay, neat questions at this level, all of them are used, okay brother, tell me son, it is clear, now let's do cos in it, come on, if you are taking so much, then let's do cos together, you will have to write again, I have a board, I have a board, you will have to write again, you will have to write again, I have a board, you will have to write again, I have a board, now tell me, write it, see from where, 92, I am understanding, where are you stumbling, it is the level of today's lecture, brother, we are touching a level, it is fun, see how many basics were starting, and we are bringing it to this level, now see how movie number 2 is connected, it is a complete circle, everything together makes the whole trigonome, and the trigonome will be very easy, get ready, get ready, get ready, very good, you have a stab, you are a bad boy, now see, when is cos positive, when is cos positive, all will be positive in the first, and conquered cos will be positive in the fourth, positive in the first and fourth, negative in the second and third, put the sign, cos 90 minus theta, what comes in the first, cos is positive, 90 plus theta, what is cos in the second, it is negative, 180 minus theta, in the second, it will be negative, 180 plus theta, in the third, it will be negative, 270 minus theta, in the third, it will be negative, 270 plus theta, in the fourth, cos is positive, all Sindhu target conquered, in the first, all are positive, in the second, sign, in the third, 10, in the fourth, cos is positive, 360 minus theta is positive, 360 plus theta means in the first, it is positive, and minus theta is positive in the fourth, then the same simple rule, wife's control, in 90 and 270, who is the wife of cos, wife of sign is cos, wife of cos is sign, when to go, when to go, in 90, sign theta, when to go.
Now, in the rest, no control is there, cos theta, cos theta, cos theta, cos theta, cos theta, you have removed all cos theta, no new formula required, clear, child, wife of sign is cos, wife of cos is sign, wife is being controlled, in the first, it is negative, in the second, it is positive, in the third, it is negative, in the fourth, it is positive, in the fifth, it is negative, in the sixth, it is negative. in the sixth, it is positive, in the seventh, it is negative, in the eighth, it is positive. in the tenth, it is positive, in the tenth, it is negative, in the tenth, it is positive. in the tenth, it is positive, in the tenth, it is negative, in the tenth, it is positive. in the tenth, it is cot, in the tenth, it is cot, in the cause, it is cosine, in the cause, it is complementary, in the cause, it is complementary, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot,
in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot. So, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, it is cot, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot, in the cause, it is cot. So, you are a coward. And then, in all these, ten will come, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten. Hint, first may all positive, second may sign positive, third may ten positive, fourth may cause positive.

92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 67, 63, 67, 68, 69, 61, 62, 63, 62, 63, broken Sign You will say it fast, it will look like someone has read a mantra and gone mad I have done it before, go to hell I don't believe You can't do it faster than me Wrong, which one is wrong? Tell me which one is wrong See It has been captured, it has been captured, see the sign is first, second is positive, positive Third is negative, negative Fourth is negative, negative Fourth is negative, positive or negative, whatever it is If we see the cost, first is positive, second is negative, negative, third is negative, fourth is negative, fifth is Sorry, third is negative, negative, fourth is positive Then positive, here the cost is absolutely correct If I talk about 10, then positive in first, negative in second, negative in second, positive in third, positive, negative, negative, positive, negative, whatever it is Okay And if we talk about capture So in 90, the sign cost has been done, in 270, the sign cost has been done, the rest has not changed in anyone Capture cost has been signed, here the cost has been signed, the remaining cost is in every place What is done here In 90, the cost of 10 has been done, in 270, the cost of 10 has been done, the rest of 10, 10, 10, 10 is there, everything is done right, check has also been done Okay, is this clear? Which second one is wrong? 90 plus theta cos theta, why it is wrong? In the second quadrant What is the sign in the second quadrant? It is positive See second one in this 90 minus theta sin theta plus, in the second quadrant, the cost is negative I said first sign it, later see when the wife will go or not Tell me which one is wrong, I don't think it is wrong 180 minus theta minus 10 theta, 180 plus theta plus 90, this is correct What is the mistake? Which one is wrong? Cos minus theta, no cos minus theta is plus cos theta, minus does not come out, remember Minus in sin and minus in 10, because it is in the fourth What happens in the fourth? Cos is positive So in cos, the minus ends inside, okay, minus Okay, correct You have to study at this level, brother Okay, by doing this, when you know this Then you can ask questions to the kids Now in the world, whatever value you have at your level, you can get it This is a challenge for you again You have to do it, okay brother Did you enjoy it? Okay Now when you have to get these values 90, 120, 130, 150, all these values get stuck So see how it happens, what will you study in tomorrow's class? In tomorrow's class, you will learn to get all these values Or look at it for 2 minutes Someone told him to get the sin of 120 degrees
Don't be scared, write it down, you can solve it in two ways Look, I am showing it to you slowly, look at it carefully, look at it for 2 minutes, it is just getting over Either write it as 180 minus 60, or you can write it as 90 plus 30, 120 Now, you put this, sin 180 minus theta, do it quickly, what will happen in the second? Sin will be positive and it will not change, plus sin theta will be there Therefore, sin of 180 minus 60 will become sin 60 will become root 3 by 2 The value is out, sin 90 plus theta Now you will know that it is plus cos theta Okay, so sin 90 plus 30 will become cos 30 Whatever it is, it is root 3 by 2, the same answer will come In the same way, you can get all the values You can get all the values In the same way, you can get all the values So your great homework You have to find the values of sin, cos, tan For which angle, see We have time till 6 o'clock, don't worry There is a lot of time You know something 0, 30, 45, this is a cute value Now this value will come 120, 135, 160, 150, 180 Then it will come, how much value will come after 180 Let's add 30 to 180, 210, 225 Then in this, 240, 270 It will be fun, see 270 has happened It's not over yet It's not over yet, wait Now you should know this much 270, 300, 315, 330, 360 You should know this much You have to do this table What we have learned today, all the values come out All the values, this all can be solved with today's knowledge Identity is here What we have learned today, it can be solved completely We will solve For this, I will take an extra class Let's see, it depends on you If everyone can do it, then it's fine We will take another class You have to do this Now you don't have to keep anything You don't have to keep anything If you know this concept See how hard I worked to come here I watched 2-3 movies If you know this and this Then you will do this If you start doing this Then you will get all these values All these values You can solve Do you understand? If you say, I will show you one more sine cosine Then you can leave This is your work It will take 1-2 hours I will say 1-2 hours But the one who does this He will break the trigonometry Today's lecture was advanced level You felt what is advanced level lecture You felt what is advanced level lecture We have reached here And how many basics we have done Sin 30, 60 values I am trying to bring it from there to there What is 315? Sine cos 10 Sine 225 10, 300 Cos 315 The question is Cos 315 Because I can see it near 360 I can do it with 270 plus 45 I am cos 360
I will write it as cos 360 minus 45 Now cos of 360 minus theta In the fourth quadrant, the cos is positive It will not be taken, plus cos theta I have put identities So how much will cos 360 minus 45 be? Cos 45 1 by root 2 The answer is You can get any value You can use the identities You understand Otherwise, if you do not read this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 You have to keep 36 values Which was not possible Okay You can get any value With the help of these identities You should know these identities If you do not know the identities Then you will not be able to do anything Okay Is it clear You can get any value In this way In fact, these are the values of the future Someone said by chance I am teaching you This is not for everyone But you can learn I said take out 10 of 750 degrees In the same way 10 of 720 plus 30 It comes out Let's see what 720 comes on 90 will come here 0, 90, 18, 27, 36 45 It will come here 72 There will be no change in it It will not be taken It will be plus 10 theta 1 by root 3 And you can go on and on You can get infinite values You do not have to do anything I am removing it You can go for anything Trigger words part 1 is done Now you have to sit And make all the notes I will make it tomorrow Tomorrow's whole lecture will be on identities It will come only tomorrow Otherwise 10 will fly from above Do you understand the level Will you be able to keep this level You say no I will lower your level How do we teach It goes like this 0, 30, 45 60, 90 There is no concept of 170 120, 135 150, 180 Here we will make glass Glass means Sign 0, 1 by 2, 1 by root 2 Glass is same Root 3 by 2 1 by root 2 This is 2 1 by 2 will be 0 Like glass This will be 1 Root 3 by 2 1 by root 2 1 by 2 1 by 2 1 by root 2 Root 3 by 2 1 1 by root 3 1 by root 3 Root 3 1 by root 3 0 This will be negative Sign will be plus If you want to keep You can keep it I have taught the concept People keep it Then I will teach you this level And finish Sir keep this level This is the end This is the neat level This is the neat level Neat level This is the advanced level This is the advanced level This is the advanced level If you don't want You can tell me Neat level Basic level Advanced level Your wish Then people teach like this I will teach like this It's simple Last year I taught like this Last year I taught like this Because I didn't know Neat level will be like this If you want to go to that level Then tell me I will teach you I will teach you You will remember Mirror You can do it with mirror But I have taught you I have taught you Till where I have taught You don't know And in the lack of time I can teach you more So You can comment After the lecture You can comment Neat basic level Or advanced level It's up to you
I convert whatever you say I don't have any problem I want to take you to this level You just support me Every teacher is facing this problem We are not able to support you If you support us We will die for you If you give me a chance to teach I will teach you to this level You finish JEE advanced in mock test You will finish JEE advanced In free You will finish physics of advanced Maths will be left I will teach you physics We will study at this level Because advanced questions are coming And in NEET that question is coming to cut in a minute I will make you do JEE advanced PYQ in the class There will be NEET PYQ JEE mains There will be JEE advanced PYQ I have put it in telegram last year Everyone is crying about NEET but it was tough I didn't make you do 2-5 questions in NEET But the rest of the questions came from notes And today there is a life proof of one question in which the value did not change Last year Arjuna has taught The question is in NEET with the exact same value Even the value is the same Answer is 0.75 Exact same value Antion plane friction concept Exact same to same question came And if you look at the concept of the child, there were a lot of answers But you will understand one question How good it would have been if the value was stuck So last year also You will not let me teach children I will teach you to this level, it will be fun It is the promise of the professor This PW books is a new app PW free of cost In this, NCIT will be explained to you line by line I have started making it for you for physics For you NCIT line by line I have made the first chapter of unit and measurement I am making 2-3 chapters of it every week So all the children are teaching you PW teachers In this, we are explaining NCIT line by line So that the way you read NCIT, there is NCIT in it If you click anywhere, the video will come below the line So by chance, if there is a problem in school, you can refer this book PW books app Reading is free of cost, there is no such money I have taken it out for you so that the children do not have a problem in school And in the class, we also do not have one line of NCIT many times I have taken it out for you So you can download it whenever you want Thank you very much I hope you understood this lecture I made it with a lot of hard work It took me more than 4-5 hours to make this lecture I have been sitting for that lecture since morning You may not know I have been sitting since 8 am to make this lecture I was working like crazy That I have to take it to that level Vipin sir has 15 minutes in the class Don't worry Tomorrow I will have a lecture in the second slot Vipin sir will not be able to take the class in the second slot Vipin sir has to go to the second slot There is a launch of flying Your batch was flying last year So Vipin sir has to go to launch etc. So Vipin sir will not be able to take the class in the second slot So I have given Vipin sir the first slot I will take it in the second slot Let's go I hope your doubts are not too much I hope Physics paper was made by this sir Listen, I did not make the paper But there were a lot of questions Why did the cost go down after 90? Because the cost is negative in the second quadrant Video call please sir I don't want to waste time How to be talented like you I am not talented I have worked hard I will tell you my story I have worked hard every day I prepare for every new exam I have started preparing I have started studying I have started going to college every Sunday I am upgrading myself I am learning AI for you I can use AI to study I don't know anything about computers I have very less knowledge I am learning AI for you I have started AI course I go to college every Sunday I have started studying I am going to get married I have to lose weight I am going to the gym every morning I am trying to study for you You can study from 180 to 90 90 will not be defined 90 will not be defined 270 will not be defined It's okay It won't be fast It will be fast with practice I have done tremendous practice I have written all these in my hand I am not kidding If you want to sit these formulas inside Write it in your hand Write it in your hand I am not kidding I will tell you my story Write all these formulas in your hand 90 percent Write it in your hand Ask your mom to write it in Dad's hand People experiment Write it in everyone's hand In their face Bro made them stand like underwear I have taken this full drop Write it in Palms Write in Palms Write it in Happy Palms Write it in Happy Palms Write it in Happy Palms
Write it in Happy Palms Write it in Happy Palms It will take 2-3 hobs But If you do it You have promised My stop is at the end of the month I will be on leave from 30 to 4 I have stopped I have stopped I have to go very far for it My in-laws My wife's family They are from North-East India I have to go there to stop They are from North-East India 7 sisters I have to stop there Bye Bachapati, Love you See you in the next class If you want to study, promise If you want to do it, then do it If you want to do it, then do it If you want to do it, then do it If you want to do it, then do it Bye Bachapati, Love you
