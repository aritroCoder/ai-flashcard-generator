        "concept": "Endomembrane System",
        "explanation": "The endomembrane system is a group of interconnected organelles in eukaryotic cells that work together to modify, package, and transport lipids and proteins. It includes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and vacuoles. These organelles are connected by vesicles that transport materials between them."

        "concept": "Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)",
        "explanation": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of membranous tubules and sacs called cisternae. It is involved in the synthesis of proteins and lipids. The rough ER has ribosomes attached to its surface and synthesizes proteins, while the smooth ER lacks ribosomes and synthesizes lipids and steroid hormones."

        "concept": "Golgi Apparatus",
        "explanation": "The Golgi apparatus is a series of flattened membrane-bound sacs called cisternae. It modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids received from the ER. The Golgi apparatus has a cis face (receiving side) and a trans face (shipping side). It is also involved in the formation of lysosomes."

        "concept": "Lysosomes",
        "explanation": "Lysosomes are membrane-bound vesicles that contain hydrolytic enzymes capable of breaking down biomolecules. They are involved in the digestion of cellular waste, pathogens, and damaged organelles. Lysosomes maintain an acidic environment to activate their enzymes."

        "concept": "Vacuoles",
        "explanation": "Vacuoles are large membrane-bound organelles found in plant and fungal cells. They store nutrients, waste products, and help maintain turgor pressure in plant cells. In animal cells, vacuoles are smaller and involved in storage and transport."

        "concept": "Ribosomes",
        "explanation": "Ribosomes are small, non-membrane-bound organelles composed of rRNA and proteins. They are the sites of protein synthesis and can be found floating freely in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough ER."

        "concept": "Protein Synthesis",
        "explanation": "Protein synthesis occurs in two main stages: transcription and translation. Transcription takes place in the nucleus where DNA is transcribed into mRNA. Translation occurs in the cytoplasm where ribosomes translate mRNA into a polypeptide chain."
