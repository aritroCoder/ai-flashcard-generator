        "explanation": "When calculating the area of a shape, the result should be reported with the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the least significant figures. For example, if the radius of a disk is 1.2 cm, the area should be reported as 4.5 cm²."

        "concept": "Atomic Mass and Molar Mass",
        "explanation": "The atomic mass of an element is the mass of one atom of that element, usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu). The molar mass is the mass of one mole of atoms of that element, expressed in grams. For example, the atomic mass of calcium is 40 amu, and its molar mass is 40 grams."

        "explanation": "A mole is a unit that represents $6.022 \\times 10^{23}$ entities (atoms, molecules, etc.). It is a numerical prefix similar to 'dozen' but much larger. For example, one mole of electrons is $6.022 \\times 10^{23}$ electrons."

        "explanation": "The molar mass of a compound is the mass of one mole of its molecules, expressed in grams. For example, the molar mass of water (H₂O) is 18 grams because the molecular mass of water is 18 amu."

        "explanation": "To convert from molecules to atoms, multiply the number of molecules by the number of atoms per molecule. For example, in 8 moles of O₂, there are $8 \\times 2 \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23}$ atoms of oxygen."
